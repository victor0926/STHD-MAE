# STHD-MAE: Spatial-Temporal Hierarchical Decoupled Masked Autoencoder

This repository contains the original implementation of the paper:

**"Spatial-Temporal Hierarchical Decoupled Masked Autoencoder: A Self-Supervised Learning Framework for Electrocardiogram"**

---

## ðŸš§ Current Status

This is the **initial, unrefined implementation** of the STHD-MAE framework, including:

- Pretraining code
- Downstream ECG classification task implementation

Please note:

- The code is **not yet fully organized**
- Many parts **lack detailed comments**
- The implementation **does not follow generalizable or modular design principles**

---

## ðŸ“… Updates

We are actively working on:

- Refactoring the codebase for better readability and modularity  
- Adding comprehensive documentation and comments  
- Providing preprocessing scripts and relevant data usage guidelines  

A fully polished version along with the dataset-related utilities will be released **as soon as possible**.


Stay tuned for updates!
